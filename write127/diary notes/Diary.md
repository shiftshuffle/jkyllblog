Today I went to swim, yesterday I was thinking about shadows... So I ended up sleeping late, but it was an interesting meditation, I had my key ring, the lamp from my phone and a basketball tapestry, so I was wondering if I could make the same curved lines from the ball from the shadows of the keyring, I think this question simplified (shadow thickness grows when closer to the lightsource) might be answered with projective geometry, if we knew which transformations are allowed when projecting (cast shadow) and if we had a notion of some invariant (like curvature)

In swimming I felt good, I did 2x200 combined style at good pace (race) among other things, as always I did longest distance of butterfly kicks beneath wather, no air, I almost did 50 meters but I can't pass that, maybe later.
In breathing exercises I did also freestyle with 5 (beazadas) between breaths. 
I always do like 3km total but today it was more relax since I am going to have a race sunday early morning (7am) in a (cerro) I already run the route and I liked it, amazing view the only thing that worries me a little, the down trail is very stretch and I am good in keeping speed while going down so maybe I will need to pass some people while trying not to crash :p
