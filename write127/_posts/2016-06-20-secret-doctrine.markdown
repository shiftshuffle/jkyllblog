# Book of Dzyan

This is a portion of the beautiful Stanzas by Dzyan i get to read because of my curiosity and randomness,
i get to know them because of [*The Secret Doctrine*](http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd1-1-01.htm) by H. P. Blavatsky




“Nor Aught nor Nought existed; yon bright sky<br />
Was not, nor heaven’s broad roof outstretched above.<br />
What covered all? what sheltered? what concealed?<br />
Was it the water’s fathomless abyss?<br />
There was not death — yet there was nought immortal,<br />
There was no confine betwixt day and night;<br />
The only One breathed breathless by itself,<br />
Other than It there nothing since has been.<br />
Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled<br />
In gloom profound — an ocean without light —<br />
The germ that still lay covered in the husk<br />
Burst forth, one nature, from the fervent heat.<br />

----------------------------------------
Who knows the secret? who proclaimed it here?<br />
Whence, whence this manifold creation sprang?<br />
The Gods themselves came later into being —<br />
Who knows from whence this great creation sprang?<br />
That, whence all this great creation came,<br />
Whether Its will created or was mute,<br />
The Most High Seer that is in highest heaven,<br />
He knows it — or perchance even He knows not.”  <br />

“Gazing into eternity . . .  <br />
Ere the foundations of the earth were laid,  <br />

----------------------------------------
Thou wert. And when the subterranean flame  <br />
Shall burst its prison and devour the frame . . .  <br />
Thou shalt be still as Thou wert before  <br />
And knew no change, when time shall be no more.  <br />
Oh! endless thought, divine Eternity.”
